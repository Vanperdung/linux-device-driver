Input subsystem:
    - is a collection of drivers.
    - is designed to support all input device under Linux.

The core of input subsystem is the input module, which must be loaded before
any other of the input modules - it serves as a way of communication between
two groups modules:
    1. Device drivers: is middleware between app and hardware, provides event to input modules.
    2. Event handlers: get events from input core and pass them where needed via various interfaces.
